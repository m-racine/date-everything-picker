Favorites Picker for characters from Date Everything, by Morgan L'Fey. https://morgannoonwrite.substack.com/, https://github.com/m-racine

Derived from https://github.com/antialiasis/favorite-picker

Graphics extracted from the assets in the game, assisted by https://assetripper.github.io/AssetRipper/index.html. Be careful running that on large bundle counts--it eats up RAM like the hungriest of hippos.

Note about Alt Forms:
    Jon Wick is omitted as the only special graphics for him appear to be late game, and I'll implement that stuff later. Ditto for "Timmy" instead of "Tim".

Next revisions checklist:
- Add groupings by room found in, so that you can know just your favorite bathroom dateable, or ignore the secret areas for newer players.
- Standardize the image sizes and find a better size for individual items in the picker, which was coded expecting square images such as well, Pok√©mon, or busts, rather than full views.
- Realizable versions of relevant characters.
